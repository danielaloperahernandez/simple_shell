.TH HSH 1 "12 Apr 2020" "V 1.0" "hsh usage manual"

.SH NAME

.B hsh
- command interpreter (shell)

.SH SYNOPSIS

.br
Run interactive mode:

.B ./hsh

.br
Run non-interactive mode:

.br
echo [command_string | file] |
.B ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B hsh
is a command interpreter that executes commands. Run interactive mode to get a prompt reading line by line from the standard input. Run non-interactive mode to read from a file
or command_string passed through pipe.

.B hsh
also incorporate the build-in commands
.I exit
and
.I env

.B hsh
was tested to run in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. And was designed to work as close as possible like
.I sh
(default shell).

.SH DEFINITIONS
.B word
is a sequence of characters considered as a single unit.

.B name
is a word consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.br
After a command has been split into words, the first word is assumed to be the name of a command or executable file. The subsequents arguments are passed like arguments to that command.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION

.br
If the command
.I name
do not start with slash (/), the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell build-in by that name then invoke them.

If the name is not a built-in,
.I hsh
searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name.

If the
.I name
start with slash (/), then checks if it is a valid pathname of a executable file and execute them. If it is a directory, an error message is displayed. 

.SH SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS

.br Build-ins do not receive parameters, any parameter is ignored.

.B env
print the current Environment variables.

.B exit
cause the shell to exit. the exit status is that of the last command executed.

.SH RETURN

The return value of the most recent command executed before receive the
.I EOF
(end-of-file) condition
.I Ctrl+D
or the build-in
.I exit
is invoked.

.SH EXAMPLES

The shell works like this in interactive mode:

.br
	($) pwd
.br
	/home/vagrant/simple_shell
.br
	($) exit
.br
	$

.br
Running commands with arguments:

.br
	($) ls -l
.br
	total 72
.br
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   343 Apr 12 01:02 built_in.c
.br
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   850 Apr 12 01:02 error.c
.br
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   555 Apr 12 14:27 execute_line.c
.br
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   305 Apr 10 00:46 _getenv.c
.br
	-rwxrwxr-x 1 vagrant vagrant 14563 Apr 12 12:57 hsh
.br
	($)

.br
	error.c         hsh          mini_shell          shell.h         useful_func.c
.br
	execute_line.c  list_path.c  README.md           special_case.c  _which.c
.br
